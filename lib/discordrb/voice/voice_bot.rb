  # This class represents a connection to a Discord voice server and channel. It can be used to play audio files and
  # streams and to control playback on currently playing tracks. The method {Bot#voice_connect} can be used to connect
  # to a voice channel.
  #
  # discordrb does latency adjustments every now and then to improve playback quality. I made sure to put useful
  # defaults for the adjustment parameters, but if the sound is patchy or too fast (or the speed varies a lot) you
  # should check the parameters and adjust them to your connection: {VoiceBot#adjust_interval},
  # {VoiceBot#adjust_offset}, and {VoiceBot#adjust_average}.

    attr_reader :encoder

    # discordrb will occasionally measure the time it takes to send a packet, and adjust future delay times based
    # on that data. This makes voice playback more smooth, because if packets are sent too slowly, the audio will
    # sound patchy, and if they're sent too quickly, packets will "pile up" and occasionally skip some data or
    # play parts back too fast. How often these measurements should be done depends a lot on the system, and if it's
    # done too quickly, especially on slow connections, the playback speed will vary wildly; if it's done too slowly
    # however, small errors will cause quality problems for a longer time.
    # @return [Integer] how frequently audio length adjustments should be done, in ideal packets (20 ms).
    attr_accessor :adjust_interval

    # This particular value is also important because ffmpeg may take longer to process the first few packets. It is
    # recommended to set this to 10 at maximum, otherwise it will take too long to make the first adjustment, but it
    # shouldn't be any higher than {#adjust_interval}, otherwise no adjustments will take place. If {#adjust_interval}
    # is at a value higher than 10, this value should not be changed at all.
    # @see #adjust_interval
    # @return [Integer] the packet number (1 packet = 20 ms) at which length adjustments should start.
    attr_accessor :adjust_offset

    # This value determines whether or not the adjustment length should be averaged with the previous value. This may
    # be useful on slower connections where latencies vary a lot. In general, it will make adjustments more smooth,
    # but whether that is desired behaviour should be tried on a case-by-case basis.
    # @see #adjust_interval
    # @return [true, false] whether adjustment lengths should be averaged with the respective previous value.

    # @see #adjust_interval

    attr_accessor :adjust_debug

    # If this value is set, no length adjustments will ever be done and this value will always be used as the length
    # (i. e. packets will be sent every N seconds). Be careful not to set it too low as to not spam Discord's servers.
    # The ideal length is 20 ms (accessible by the {Discordrb::Voice::IDEAL_LENGTH} constant), this value should be
    # slightly lower than that because encoding + sending takes time. Note that sending DCA files is significantly
    # faster than sending regular audio files (usually about four times as fast), so you might want to set this value
    # to something else if you're sending a DCA file.
