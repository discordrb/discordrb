    #   See {CommandBot#set_user_permission} and {CommandBot#set_role_permission}.
    # @option attributes [String, false] :permission_message Message to display when a user does not have sufficient
    #   permissions to execute a command. %name% in the message will be replaced with the name of the command. Disable
    #   the message by setting this option to false.
    # @option attributes [Array<Symbol>] :required_permissions Discord action permissions (e.g. `:kick_members`) that
    #   should be required to use this command. See {Discordrb::Permissions::Flags} for a list.

    # @option attributes [true, false] :chain_usable Whether this command is able to be used inside of a command chain
    #   or sub-chain. Typically used for administrative commands that shouldn't be done carelessly.

    #   the help command or if the user uses it wrong.
    # @option attributes [Integer] :min_args The minimum number of arguments this command should have. If a user
    #   attempts to call the command with fewer arguments, the usage information will be displayed, if it exists.
    # @option attributes [Integer] :max_args The maximum number of arguments the command should have.
    # @option attributes [String] :rate_limit_message The message that should be displayed if the command hits a rate
    #   limit. None if unspecified or nil. %time% in the message will be replaced with the time in seconds when the
    #   command will be available again.
    # @option attributes [Symbol] :bucket The rate limit bucket that should be used for rate limiting. No rate limiting
    #   will be done if unspecified or nil.
    # @yield The block is executed when the command is executed.
    # @yieldparam event [CommandEvent] The event of the message that contained the command.
    # @return [Command] The command that was added.
