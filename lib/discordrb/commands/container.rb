    # Adds a new command to the container.
    # @param name [Symbol] The name of the command to add.
    # @param attributes [Hash] The attributes to initialize the command with.
    # @option attributes [Integer] :permission_level The minimum permission level that can use this command, inclusive.
    #   See {CommandBot#set_user_permission} and {CommandBot#set_role_permission}.
    # @option attributes [String, false] :permission_message Message to display when a user does not have sufficient
    #   permissions to execute a command. %name% in the message will be replaced with the name of the command. Disable
    #   the message by setting this option to false.
    # @option attributes [Array<Symbol>] :required_permissions Discord action permissions (e.g. `:kick_members`) that
    #   should be required to use this command. See {Discordrb::Permissions::FLAGS} for a list.
    # @option attributes [Array<Role>, Array<String, Integer>] :required_roles Roles, or their IDs, that user must have to use this command
    #   (user must have all of them).
    # @option attributes [Array<Role>, Array<String, Integer>] :allowed_roles Roles, or their IDs, that user should have to use this command
    #   (user should have at least one of them).
    # @option attributes [Array<String, Integer, Channel>] :channels The channels that this command can be used on. An
    #   empty array indicates it can be used on any channel. Supersedes the command bot attribute.
    # @option attributes [true, false] :chain_usable Whether this command is able to be used inside of a command chain
    #   or sub-chain. Typically used for administrative commands that shouldn't be done carelessly.
    # @option attributes [true, false] :help_available Whether this command is visible in the help command. See the
    #   :help_command attribute of {CommandBot#initialize}.
    # @option attributes [String] :description A short description of what this command does. Will be shown in the help
    #   command if the user asks for it.
    # @option attributes [String] :usage A short description of how this command should be used. Will be displayed in
    #   the help command or if the user uses it wrong.
    # @option attributes [Array<Class>] :arg_types An array of argument classes which will be used for type-checking.
    #   Hard-coded for some native classes, but can be used with any class that implements static
    #   method `from_argument`.
    # @option attributes [Integer] :min_args The minimum number of arguments this command should have. If a user
    #   attempts to call the command with fewer arguments, the usage information will be displayed, if it exists.
    # @option attributes [Integer] :max_args The maximum number of arguments the command should have.
    # @option attributes [String] :rate_limit_message The message that should be displayed if the command hits a rate
    #   limit. None if unspecified or nil. %time% in the message will be replaced with the time in seconds when the
    #   command will be available again.
    # @option attributes [Symbol] :bucket The rate limit bucket that should be used for rate limiting. No rate limiting
    #   will be done if unspecified or nil.
    # @option attributes [String, #call] :rescue A string to respond with, or a block to be called in the event an exception
    #   is raised internally. If given a String, `%exception%` will be substituted with the exception's `#message`. If given
    #   a `Proc`, it will be passed the `CommandEvent` along with the `Exception`.
    # @yield The block is executed when the command is executed.
    # @yieldparam event [CommandEvent] The event of the message that contained the command.
    # @note `LocalJumpError`s are rescued from internally, giving bots the opportunity to use `return` or `break` in
    #   their blocks without propagating an exception.
