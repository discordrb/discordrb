  # Awaits are a way to register new, temporary event handlers on the fly. Awaits can be
  # registered using {Bot#add_await}, {User#await}, {Message#await} and {Channel#await}.
  #
  # Awaits contain a block that will be called before the await event will be triggered.
  # If this block returns anything that is not `false` exactly, the await will be deleted.
  # If no block is present, the await will also be deleted. This is an easy way to make
  # temporary events that are only temporary under certain conditions.
  #
  # Besides the given block, an {Discordrb::Events::AwaitEvent} will also be executed with the key and
  # the type of the await that was triggered. It's possible to register multiple events
  # that trigger on the same await.

    # The key that uniquely identifies this await.

    # @return [Class] The event class.
    attr_reader :type

    # The attributes of the event that will be listened for.
    # @return [Hash] A hash of attributes.

    # and return its result along with this await's key.
