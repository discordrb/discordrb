name: Feature Request
about: Request a new feature, or change an existing one

---

<!---
  Describe your feature request in as much detail as you can here.

  Include why you want this feature. For example:

  - It is a feature supported by Discord's API, but missing from the library

  - It is a feature that would simplify a lot of your bots code

  - It is a feature present in other popular Discord libraries

  Include simple code examples (pseudocode is fine) that demonstrate
  what you want to do.

  Do your best to think about how this new feature would impact the code
  of other people who use discordrb, and not just your own bot's codebase.
