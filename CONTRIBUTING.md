# Contributing guidelines

Any contributions are very much appreciated! This project is relatively relaxed when it comes to guidelines, however
there are still some things that would be nice to have considered.

For bug reports, please try to include a code sample if at all appropriate for
the issue, so we can reproduce it on our own machines.

For PRs, please make sure that you tested your code before every push; it's a little annoying to keep having to get back
to a PR because of small avoidable oversights. (Huge bonus points if you're adding specs for your code! This project
has very few specs in places where it should have more so every added spec is very much appreciated.)

If you have any questions at all, don't be afraid to ask in the [discordrb channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/0SBTUU1wZTWfFQL2).
