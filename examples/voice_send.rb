# discordrb can send music or other audio data to voice channels. This example exists to show that off.
#
# To avoid copyright infringement, the example music I will be using is a self-composed piece of highly debatable
# quality. If you want something better you can replace the files in the data/ directory. Make sure to execute this
# example from the appropriate place, so that it has access to the files in that directory.

  # The `voice_channel` method returns the voice channel the user is currently in, or `nil` if the user is not in a
  # voice channel.
  channel = event.user.voice_channel

  # Here we return from the command unless the channel is not nil (i. e. the user is in a voice channel). The `next`
  # construct can be used to exit a command prematurely, and even send a message while we're at it.

  # will be connected and ready to play stuff back.

  # `event.voice` is a helper method that gets the correct voice bot on the server the bot is currently in. Since a
  # bot may be connected to more than one voice channel (never more than one on the same server, though), this is
  # necessary to allow the differentiation of servers.

# DCA is a custom audio format developed by a couple people from the Discord API community (including myself, meew0).
# It represents the audio data exactly as Discord wants it in a format that is very simple to parse, so libraries can
# very easily add support for it. It has the advantage that absolutely no transcoding has to be done, so it is very
# light on CPU in comparison to `play_file`.
#
# A conversion utility that converts existing audio files to DCA can be found here: https://github.com/nstafie/dca-rs
bot.command(:play_dca) do |event|
  voice_bot = event.voice

  # Since the DCA format is non-standard (i.e. ffmpeg doesn't support it), a separate method other than `play_file` has
  # to be used to play DCA files back. `play_dca` fulfills that role.
