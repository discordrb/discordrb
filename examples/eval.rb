# Eval bots are useful for developers because they give you a way to execute code directly from your Discord channel,
# e.g. to quickly check something, demonstrate something to other, or something else entirely. Special care must be
# taken since anyone with access to the command can execute arbitrary code on your system which may potentially be
# malicious.
